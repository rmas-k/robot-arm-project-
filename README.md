ðŸ¤– 3D Robot Arm â€“ Tinkercad

This is a simple 3D model of a robotic arm designed using Tinkercad.
The arm includes:
	â€¢	A round base for support
	â€¢	A vertical body made of stacked blocks

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
	â€¢	Tinkercad basic shapes (cylinder, box, hole)

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Basic prototype for learning robotic arm structure and 3D modeling.
